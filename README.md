## Description

BasicAirData Clinometer is a simple App to measure the inclination angles of your device with respect to gravity's direction using the onboard accelerometers.<br>
It's a basic and lightweight App with geometric-inspired graphics, that can be used as Clinometer or Bubble Level.<br>
It is intended to measure, not store data.<br>

The app measures the following angles:<br>
- **X** = _Yellow_ - The angle between the horizontal plane and the horizontal axis of the screen<br>
- **Y** = _Yellow_ - The angle between the horizontal plane and the vertical axis of the screen<br>
- **Z** = _Yellow_ - The angle between the horizontal plane and the axis that comes out perpendicular to the screen<br>
- **Pitch** = _White_ - The angle between the contour line (inclined, white) and the reference axis (horizontal or vertical, white) on the screen plane<br>
- **Roll** = _White_ - The angle between the screen and the horizontal plane<br>

Read here the [Getting Started Guide](https://www.basicairdata.eu/projects/android/android-clinometer/).<br>

Please go on Settings and calibrate it before the use.<br>
The precision of the measurement mainly depends on the accuracy of the calibration: use a good horizontal and vertical reference for calibration. 

The app is 100% Free and Open Source.
